<h1>Automated AWS Cost Optimization: Detecting and Deleting stale resources Snapshots</h1>
<h2>This project aims to optimize AWS cloud costs by automating the detection and removal of stale EBS snapshots. AWS resources, particularly snapshots, can accumulate over time and incur unnecessary costs if not actively managed. By implementing automated scripts and monitoring tools, this project identifies such resources, flags them as stale, and safely deletes unnecessary snapshots, reducing overall cloud expenses.</h2>

<h1>Key Features:</h1>

<h2>Automated Snapshot Identification: Detects unused or outdated snapshots across your AWS environment.
Cost Savings: Helps reduce AWS storage costs by cleaning up unneeded snapshots.
Scheduling & Alerts: Allows scheduled cleanup and notifications for resource management.
Scalable & Flexible: Designed to work across different AWS services and can be customized to specific use cases.</h2>
