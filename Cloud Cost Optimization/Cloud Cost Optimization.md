<h1>Automated AWS Cost Optimization: Detecting and Deleting stale resources Snapshots</h1>
<h2>This project aims to optimize AWS cloud costs by automating the detection and removal of stale EBS snapshots. 
  
Motto of the Project:
AWS resources, particularly snapshots, can accumulate over time and incur unnecessary costs if not actively managed. By implementing automated scripts and monitoring tools, this project identifies such stale resources, flags them, and safely deletes unnecessary snapshots, effectively reducing overall cloud expenses.</h2>

<h1>Key Features</h1>
